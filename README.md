### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack web developer. I work as a full-time software engineer (backend) at Happy5. Ruby on Rails is my go-to framework.

Apart from my main full-time job, here's what I do in the meantime:
- [Tanggal Merah Terdekat](https://tanggal-merah-terdekat.vercel.app), a simple website that informs the nearest public holiday in Indonesia.
- [WIR: Worth Image Resizer](https://github.com/adiprnm/wir), a gem to resize and compress images in bulk.
- [Cirian](https://cirian.my.id), a web application to store your favorite things and share them with others: tweets, videos, etc.
- [Homestay App (WIP)](#), a web application for homestay, rental, and tour package reservations.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adi_prnm) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/adi-prnm).
